'''
Given a string, s, return the total number of substring within s that contain the same character.
Note: You may assume that s only contains lowercase alphabetical characters.

Ex: Given the following string sâ€¦

s = "aabca", return 6 ("a" appears 3 times, "aa" appears 1 time, "b" appears 1 time, and "c" appears 1 time).
