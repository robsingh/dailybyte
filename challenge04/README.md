House Inventory Tracker

What if I could write a simple program that allowed me to create a list of rooms in my house and for each room a list of items along with their dollar values?

## Description

* Create a list of rooms (doesn't have to use the list type).
* Each room in your rooms list needs to contain at least 5 items (i.e. TV, couch, study table, etc) and the relative dollar value of each item.
* The script you will write will print out each room along with the individual items and values. This needs to be properly formatted.
* You can modify the inventory or extend the functionality to include more features like adding or removing items if desired.


## Features to be added later
* Create some sort of program shell with a menu system around this. ie, “Which room would you like to list out?”
* If you’re really game, allow users to create rooms and update information.
* You can modify the inventory or extend the functionality to include more features like adding or removing items. 
* You could even make an API with Flask or your preferred framework.
* Print the total dollar value of each room and the entire house.
* Have persistent storage of the data. sqlite3 = stdlib and light-weight, but feel free to use your preferred DB / module.
