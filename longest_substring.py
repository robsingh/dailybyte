'''
Given a string 's' and an integer 'k', return the length of the longest substring in 's' you can create that contains a single capital 
letter. 
You may apply 'k' operations to 's' where a single operation consists of selecting one capital letter and modifying it to be 
another capital letter.
Note: s will only contain uppercase alphabetical characters.

Ex: Given the following s and kâ€¦

s = "BBAA", k = 2, return 4 (both B's can be changed to A's or both A's can be changed to B's).
'''

'''
Input: string 's' containing only uppercase letters.
       integer 'k' represents the max number of changes you can make.

Output: length of longest substring that can be created, all characters in the substring are the same.
