This week you will write a script to calculate the (language) dictionary word that would have the most value in Scrabble.

Read in dictionary.txt (a copy of /usr/share/dict/words on my Mac) and 
calculate the word that has the most value in Scrabble based on LETTER_SCORES which is imported in wordvalue-template.py.
